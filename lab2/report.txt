---Token---

This class contains all neccessary data for a token. The class variables
contains the owners fingerprint, their clearance level and whether the token is
valid or not. It is also able to invalidate itself.

We chose to store whether a token is valid or not inside the token itself since
in this simulated system we cannot really guarantee that a token cannot be
reused elsewhere (by letting the token reader eat the card or similar in real
systems).

---EnrollmentStation---

This is a class to simulate the enrollment station. It contains a list of all
the issued tokens (to avoid duplicates) and a method to issue a new token.

The issued tokens list is implemented as a map to be able to quickly look up a
user and to easily see whether that user is already registered.

---IDStation---

Simulates the ID station. Each station is connected to a single door and stores
the required clearance level and can authenticate a token.

The authentication method just checks if a users fingerprint matches the token
and if they have sufficient clearance and passes that back to the main system.

---SuperSystem---

A system for that handles communications between the different parts of the
system. It also handles opening door or raising an alarm depeneding on whether
the ID station validated a token.
